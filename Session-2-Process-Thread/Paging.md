# How Paging Works

- Process is divided into pages
- RAM is divided into frames
- OS load pages in any free frame
- A Page Table stores mapping (Page Number = Frame Number)
- CPU generates logical address
- MMU(Memory Management Unit) converts into physical address

### Example

- Page Size = 4 KB = 4 * 2^10 Bytes = 4096 bytes
- Logical Address = 20500
- Logical address is generated by CPU, its virtual address
- Logical address starts from 0

**Calculate Page Number**

- 20500/4096 = 5 (Page Number)
- offset = 20500 % 4096 = 20

**Page Table**
- Page 5 --> Frame 12

**Count Physical Address**
- (12*4096) + 20 = 49172 (Actual Exist in RAM)
- Physical Address actual RAM

**Disadvantage**
- Internal Framentation
- page table can overhead
- extra memory access time
- in case of page fault it can slow performance
