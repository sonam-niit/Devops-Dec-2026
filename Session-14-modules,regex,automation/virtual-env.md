# Python virtual Environment & Dependency management

- A Python Virtual Environment is an isolated workspace (folder) which allows you to manage different versions for different projects without any conflict

- For creating projects sometimes we are using some third party packages 
- like
    + flask
    + django many more
- to use them we need to download
- for that we can use pip package manager
- with help of it we can install and uninstall thord party packages
- but at a time we can manage single version in system

### What if my different app using diff version
- this problem we can solve using VE (virtual environment)
- means we can manage seperate versions folder wise
