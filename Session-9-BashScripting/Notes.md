# variables

- A variable is just a name that stores value (text,number,command output etc..)
- name="sonam"
- no space arround = 
- also names are case sensitive means name and Name is different

- access using $ symbol

- bash variables dont have any type like number or string they all are string by default

- in value if you want to give space use "" else it will be ok

# Loops

- iterate over a list or range of numbers
- repeating same process multiple times
